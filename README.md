# FlappyBird-Neuroevolution-AI

A Javascript implementation of FlappyBird, where on the implementation of Neuroevolution the Bird learns to adapt to its environment by learning through neuroevolution

# Running the Model
Clone the rep first. Then open the files and change the location information in the two Javascript files and the one HTML file so that all of them are interconnected.

run 'index.html' file in a browser. The Neuroevolution model will be deployed. The bird will first learn by exploring the environment into multiple Birds, each running separate NeuralNetworks. You can speed up the Evolution process. Soon the bird would be able to move through the environment on its own without making any mistakes.
